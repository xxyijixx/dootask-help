# Anonymous Messages

Anonymous messaging is a feature in the instant messaging module that allows users to send messages through a bot while hiding their identity during chats. Recipients will not be able to know the true source of the message.

## Feature Description

- **Initiating Anonymous Messages**  
  When having a one-on-one chat with others, click the ⊕ button next to the input box and select "Anonymous Message" to enter the message content you want to send anonymously, without displaying sender information.

- **Use Cases**  
  - Sending sensitive content while wanting to keep identity private
  - Providing suggestions or feedback without direct contact
  - Creating a more private communication environment

## How to Use

1. **Enter Chat Interface and Select Anonymous Mode**  
   Open the instant messaging module, start a chat with the target user, and select "Anonymous Mode" in the message input box.

## Important Notes

- **Anonymous Limitations**:  
  - Anonymous messages are only available for one-on-one chats, not supported in group chats.
  - Misuse of the anonymous feature (such as harassment or sending illegal content) may result in feature restrictions or account suspension.

- **Feedback and Records**:  
  While recipients won't know the message source, the platform records messaging behavior to prevent abuse.

# Message delivery and reading status in instant messaging apps

Understanding message delivery and reading status is an important part of the user experience in instant messaging apps. This section details the display and functionality of message status in private and group chats.

## Private chat message status

In private chats, message delivery and reading status are indicated by check marks to help users understand whether their messages have been received and read by the recipient.

- **Single check mark: message successfully sent**
- When a user sends a message, a single check mark appears next to the message, indicating that the message has been successfully sent to the server.
- This means that the message has arrived at the recipient's device, but they may not have viewed it yet.

- **Double check: message has been read**
- When the recipient opens the chat window and views the message, the single check mark will turn into a double check.
- This indicates that the recipient has read the message, confirming that they have seen the information sent.

## Group chat message status

In a group chat, the message reading status is indicated by a circular ring icon, allowing users to quickly understand how many group members have read the message.

- **Gray ring: message not read by everyone**
- When a message is sent to a group chat, a gray ring will appear on its right side, indicating that no group member has read the message yet.

- **Partial green ring: message partially read**
- When some group members have read the message, the ring turns partially green. The green part represents the proportion of members who have read the message.
- This provides users with a visual way to intuitively understand the reading progress.

- **Green ring: message has been read by everyone**
- When all group members have read the message, the ring turns completely green.
- This means that all participants in the conversation have read the message.

- **View reading details**
- By clicking the ring icon, users can view a specific list of members who have read and unread messages.
- **Read list**: Displays group members who have read the message.
- **Unread list**: Displays group members who have not read the message yet.

## Status update details

- **Real-time update**: Update the message status in real time according to the recipient's operation, ensuring that the sender can quickly understand the receiving status.

- **Notification mechanism**: Users can choose to turn on or off the message read status notification to balance privacy and information transparency.

The above introduces the basic design and functions of message sending and reading status in instant messaging applications. These status display methods can be further optimized and adjusted based on specific application needs and user feedback.

# Task Management

Task creation and management are crucial elements in efficient collaboration and team goal management. We will detail how to create tasks through **DooTask** and manage task settings including priority, time, collaborators, visibility, subtasks, attachments, and more.


## Task Creation Methods

In **DooTask**, there are two ways to create tasks, meeting different scenario needs:

### Quick Creation

Suitable for simple tasks, convenient for quick recording.

**Operation Process**:
1. Enter the task title.
2. Select task priority, system automatically sets time limits and completes task creation.

**Default Priority and Time Limits**:
- **Important & Urgent**: 1 day
- **Important but Not Urgent**: 3 days
- **Urgent but Not Important**: 5 days
- **Neither Important nor Urgent**: No time limit

> **Tip**: Administrators can customize priorities and time limits in system settings.

## Setting Task Properties

In the task creation window, you can set the following properties as needed:

### Task Priority

- **Important & Urgent** (1 day)
- **Important but Not Urgent** (3 days)
- **Urgent but Not Important** (5 days)
- **Neither Important nor Urgent** (no time limit)

> **Custom Priority**: Administrators can modify priority categories and time limits in system settings to adapt to different team needs.

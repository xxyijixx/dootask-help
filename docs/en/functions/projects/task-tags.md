# Task Tags

Task tags are essential tools in efficient project management. They not only help team members quickly locate tasks but also effectively improve task visualization and management efficiency in complex projects. This section will introduce the task tag functionality in **Dootask**, helping you easily manage and view tasks to ensure projects are clearer and more transparent.

## Introduction to Task Tags

The task tag feature allows users to assign specific tags to each task. Similar to task templates, tags help teams quickly identify task types, priorities, status, or any other custom properties. Tags make tasks more prominent in lists, making it easier for team members to find needed information and improve task manageability and visualization.

## Advantages of Task Tags

1. **Task Classification**  
   Through tags, tasks can be quickly categorized by type, priority, or status, allowing team members to rapidly identify key tasks and avoid missing important items.

2. **Enhanced Visualization**  
   Tags provide a clear task view, especially in complex projects, making the status or properties of each task immediately apparent and helping teams better grasp task progress.

3. **Improved Efficiency**  
   Using tags for task filtering and sorting, teams can easily focus on tasks that need priority handling, improving work efficiency.

4. **Flexible Usage**  
   Tags can be customized flexibly according to project needs, meeting the requirements of different work scenarios and ensuring each task receives appropriate identification.

## Quick Filtering and Viewing Tasks

Through efficient tag management, team members can quickly filter tasks with specific tags in the task list, helping them focus more on current work priorities. Whether by priority, task status, or task type, tags help you easily navigate through different project stages and improve task management operability.

## Flexible Customization of Task Tags

To adapt to different project needs, users can flexibly adjust tag content and usage. For example, different tags can be added for tasks at different stages, or marks can be added to tasks that need special attention, helping teams manage tasks more precisely.
